# PRODIGY-TASK-02

How it Works

The encryption process involves the following steps:

- Image Loading: Load the input image (e.g., .png, .jpg) using Python libraries like PIL (Python Imaging Library) or OpenCV.
- Pixel Manipulation: Iterate through each pixel in the image and apply a mathematical transformation. This transformation can involve shifting pixel values, applying bitwise operations, or other mathematical operations.
- Encryption Key: Use a predefined encryption key or algorithm parameters to determine how the pixel values should be modified. This key should be known to both the encryption and decryption processes.
- Output Encrypted Image: Save the manipulated pixel values as a new image file, representing the encrypted version of the original image.
